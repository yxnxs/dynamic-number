# dynamic-number

This repository primarily serves to show how one might use dynamic programming to solve problems such as the [change making problem](url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change-making_problem)
It provides a naive implementation that does not take advantage of the benefits that dynamic programming gives. There are also two more implementations that do use dynamic programming, showing a bottom up and a top down approach respectively.

# Benchmarks

In order to further highlight the impact this technique has, these implementations also contain benchmarks that can be run to see the difference in performance. The benchmarks are generated using [criterion.rs](https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs).

## Running the benchmarks and experimenting

### Requirements
In order to run the benchmarks, you will need a local copy of this repository. This can be achieved by simply downloading it as as .zip file and extracting it, or using 

```console
git clone https://github.com/yxnxs/dynamic-number.git
```

You will also need to have a working version of rust installed (refer [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)), and to generate a detailed benchmark, gnuplot must be installed. It can be obtained [here](http://www.gnuplot.info/),
but I would recommend you use your systems package manager to install it.

In the case you are on nix, this repository also provides a flake that has a devshell with both rust and gnuplot installed.

### Running the benchmarks as they are

Simply type
```console
cargo benchmark
```
The required dependencies will automatically be installed and compiled. Once this is done, criterion will commence the benchmarking process while showing it's process in your terminal.
Afterwards, you may find a detailed summary of the benchmark at `./target/criterion/NAME_OF_BENCHMARK/`. This folder will include an index.html file, which you can open in your browser for a nicer overview of things.

### Changing parameters 

If you wish to modify the benchmark and see how different values play out and affect the performance, you may open `./benches/benchmark.rs`. There, among some comments explaining the implementations, you will find at the top of the file the following 
code

```rust
mod settings {
    pub const TARGET_NUMBER: usize = 42;
    pub const AVAILABLE_NUMERS: [usize; 4] = [1, 3, 5, 7];
}
```

You can simply change these values up there and then rerun the bench, it will generate a new folder in the `./target/criterion/` with a different name, reflecting the new conditions.

Lastly, if you wish to clear previous benchmark results, you may simply type

```console
cargo clean
```

This will clear the entire project of any files generated by cargo that are not put there by you, including the benchmarks and dependencies
